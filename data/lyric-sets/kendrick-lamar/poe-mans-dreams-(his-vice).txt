Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

[Verse 1]
I used to want to see the Penitentiary
Way after elementary
Thought it was cool
To look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition had said I was suited for family ties
My momma is stressin'
My daddy tired
I need me a weapon
These niggas ride
Every minute, hour, and second
Ministers tried to save me
How I'm gonna listen
When I don't even hear God
Heaven or Hell
Base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty
You worried 'bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga
For real nigga
The same nigga that killed with ya
Will squeal with ya
I deal with ya like my son
Stare at the sun
And you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
And you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, 23 hours sending me pictures
I want you to know
That I'm so determined to blow
That you hear the music I wrote
Hope it get you off Death Row
You came home
To a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone
Then you went back in
So when I touch the pen
The Pen is in my view
I'mma get it right, just so you

[Hook]
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

[Bridge: GLC]
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me

[Verse 2]
You like to mistake a street nigga
For real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya
Will squeal with ya
I like to start it out from the bottom
And build with ya
Be on my last dollar
And split the bill with ya
I'm 23 with morals
And plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy
There's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back
And for that
I give them my torso
You think about it
And don't call me lyrical
Cause really I'm just a nigga
That's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words
To make their similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts
Of good kids and criminals
Worrisome individuals
That live life critical
So won't you bear witness
While I bare feet
So you can walk in my shoes
And get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break
Eating in that parking lot
On "Wanna Be Heard"
Probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for
The world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
He'll probably be
Out of work, laid back, while he

Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me

[Outro: GLC]
Church is definitely on the move
And now we took it up to the cathedral
Cause the "-ism" is enormous
You know what I'm talking 'bout?
We out here rotating under the five P's
Proper preparation prevents poor performance
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
Doing my thing
Cause I'm rotating when my speakers thumping
From the Windy City streets
All the way out here to the streets of Compton
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
Church is definitely on the move
And we gonna continue to hustle and grow
And develop by fire
As I rotate with my true player partner
By the name of Kendrick Lamar
You know what I'm talking 'bout?
This is the ism, this is the vision
You know what I'm talking 'bout?
You gotta get up off your ass and get it, man
That's the only way your pockets gonna expand
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Apply yourself to supply your wealth
Only limitations you'll ever have
Are those that you place upon yourself
Church is definitely on the move
You know what I'm talking 'bout?
Exercise your ism
And don't depend on no one else
Cathedral, chuch, "-ism"
