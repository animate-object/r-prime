[Intro]
Alright, here we go, third take
Real quick Ali

[Verse 1]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
Don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yessir
(Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him
(Amen) Bitch
And this is rigor mortis
And it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded
And I'm Morpheus, the matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit
You an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme
If you the shit, then I decline
I climax where you begin
And then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important
When you morph into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures
My listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style
You got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while
Just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you can fight
We always making 'em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable
And usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate
This fucking parasite
(He dead, Amen)
That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity
This is studio felony
Ferragami, so many
And cool enough for the 70's
Nigga, payback's a bitch
And bitch you been living in debt with me
Dead 'em all, and especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail
That say that he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant
Rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody
Couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q
It's just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q
Solar system and barbecue
Nothing else you can do
(He dead) Yup-yup
(Amen) I killed him
(He dead) Hahah
(Amen) Amen

[Hook]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yup-yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure
(Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask for your favorite rapper

[Verse 2]
I rapped him and made him Casper
I capture the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya
I'll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners
Won't you send us to bible study faster
Your hypocritesque reaction a blasphemy
I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done
And tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds
Don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet
And I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap
My statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek
And I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic
Anybody can see
Any assistance
Everybody deceased
I'm persistence
Recognize I be
Really too vicious
The permanent beast
And the demolition
Breaking up the streets
Better partition
Better dot your T
And I gon' mention
How the far you see
Putting my dick in
The rap industry
Everybody bitching
Getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick
In the battery
And I'm charged up
And the catastrophe
Is charged up
And the audacity
Of y'all fucks
Never could hassle me
And y'all luck
Just ran out, you'll see

[Hook]
(He dead) Yup-yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure
(Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yup-yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure
(Amen) Amen
