[Hook: Amy Winehouse]
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can’t see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hiding somewhere I can’t see
And I’m alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Yes, I’m alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry

[Verse 1]
I want someone who like the champagne I like
My a-alike, someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cooking good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't looking good
For real, the world so ill; yo, I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth, but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the President
As long as there’s no selfishness. Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease
You’re the woman I need, but where is she?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I hate when people write me hostile texts on account of my lifestyle’s perception
Invade my personal life out of the question
What are they expectin'? I be trying to reply, and
They never suppose I get my quiet time in?
They think forever I’m rolling in dough
Swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool or ass?
I’m well known, got people coming at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond, I’d gallivant around the equator if that would get me off the radar
It’s so intense, I’m on my Lilo and Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris with some lime, what is this?
An immaculate version of "Me and My Bitch" by Biggie
With all respect cause you the only one that gets me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, let’s pour some cherry wine
Everything’s good, everything’s fine
Yeah, yeah, we bring it every time
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine
Yeah, hey yo Salaam, yeah, I think they know the time
Everything’s good, everything’s fine
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine, yeah

Life is good, life is good, yeah
Life is good, no matter what, life is good
Life is good, life is good, yeah
No matter what, life is good

[Hook]
