[Intro - Kissing]
I love you so much, don't ever leave me, I won't let you leave

[Verse 1]
The ho turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love wit her
I saved that ho cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heart-broken she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna lose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jigg, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her c.r.e.a.m. I lust, now I got her I dont know how to act
When she not around, Im heated, bout' to lay somethin' flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped

[Hook]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

[Verse 2]
All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket
It's so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private
You got me karats on my wrist
I'm a savage for your kiss
Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard
Niggas always expect to see us two together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup
Cause when we hump we do it up, make sure we both will bust a dollar sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slingin' all night long, fiendin' to stroke ya
Seeing niggas wit' you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I won't sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you
Before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me cause I'm wit you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
It's hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat wit' government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I liked you better when you were illegal
But you had to get professional
Musical
Now when we fuck we use prophylactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxury, when I asked it
Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya assets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees
