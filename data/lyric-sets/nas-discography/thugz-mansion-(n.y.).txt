I want you to close ur eyes, n' invision
The most beautiful place in tha world
If you in the hood, the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey, the best journey, its a mansion
Acres of land, swimmin pools and all that, check it out

[Verse 1] - Nas
I'm capable of anything, my imagination could give me wings
To fly like doves over the streets watchin' many things
Kids walkin home from school, on drug blocks, missionaries
Pass out papers that read love god
I see faces cases, judges n jurors, masons lawyers n cops
I watch cuz every thugs face is my mirror
But this was one imparticular
This kid he was the vintage stick em up pro
16 years old did his jail since there was no where to go
Every mornin' calls his commrad to come n get em' a smoke
He insane already gone mad, blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where his sets at
Sling from dusk till dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
Chasin him, his ass was flarin
Smokin' like a chimney on remy of course he not carin
He needs a place to go to keep his mind expandin
I give em a helpin hand, bring em out to Thugz Mansion

[Hook]
Every corner, every city theres a place where lifes a lil easy
Lil hennesey, lay back and cool, every hour cuz its all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside, every wrong done
Will be alright, nothin' but peace, love n street passion
Every ghetto needs a Thugs Mansion

[Verse 2] - 2Pac
Dear mama don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the hommies I'm in heaven and it ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night
It had me shook drinking
Peppermint schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cook
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin there kickin it with Malcolm till the day game
Lil' Latasha sure grown, tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven
So come home
Maybe in time you'll understand, only God can save us
Where Miles Davis cutting lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past that passed on
They in heaven found peace that last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place
In Thugz Mansion

[Hook] (Wanna go...wanna go)

[Verse 3] - Nas
A place where death doesn't reside, jus' thugz who collide
Not to start beef but to spark trees, no cops rollin by
No policemen, no homicide, No chalk on the streets
No reason for no body's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis grey hair maybe
Cuz I feel like my eyes saw to much sufferin
Im just 20 some odd years I done lost my mother
And I cry tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Anne Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone, she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne
Where angels soar, with golden rings, in Thugz Mansion
