[Verse 1]
Peace to the Five Percenters
On-line engine inventors
Shout to them niggas
Family men, bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women
Hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone
Kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse
She fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first
Can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona
I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
That's what I named my son, Knight
He was born to be one
That's how my game was won
White 740 Beamer
Licked by an angel's tongue
I'm living dangerous son
She got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watching
She got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex
So I guess I'mma just stay

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Even though I don't like you
Next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you
Don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait do I got love for you
I might kill you but do I got love for you
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time
Want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but it's love
What a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me
I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer
Pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to stay
