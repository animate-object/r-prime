[Verse 1: Nas]
Fake thug, no love, you get the slug CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
Ninety-six ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'ze, makin mad Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes, 32 shotguns
Regulate with my Dunns
Seventeen rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on Millenniums
Twenty G bets, I'm winning 'em; threats I'm sending 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum
Ill sex adrenaline, party with villains
A case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique, with the semi TEC – who want it?
Diamonds I flaunt it, chickenheads flock, I lace 'em
Fried broiled with basil, taste 'em, crack the legs
Way out of formation, it's horizontal how I have 'em
Fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

[Refrain]
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

[Verse 2: Nas]
I peeped you frontin', I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat
Tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talking 'bout how you ran the Island in '89
Laying up, playing the yard with crazy shine
I cocked a baby 9, that nigga gravy mine
Clanked him; what was he thinkin'
On my corner when it's pay me time?
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin, something told me "Plug him!"
So dumb, felt my leg burn then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came asking me my name, what the fuck?
I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep watching all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun, and yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lighting L's, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplating war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together, Uptown coppin' the raw
But a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, word up

[Hook]
Y'all know my steelo
There ain't an army that could strike back
There ain't an army that could strike back
There ain't an army that could strike back
There ain't an army that could strike back

[Outro: Nas (AZ)]
Thug niggas, yo, to them thug niggas
Getting it on in the world, you know
To them niggas that's locked down
Doing they thing, surviving, yaknowmsaying?
To my thorough niggas New York and worldwide
Yo, to the Queensbridge Militia
'96 shit, The Firm clique
Illmatic, nigga, It Was Written though
It's been a long time coming
Y'all fake niggas, trying to copy
Better come with the real though, fake ass niggas, yo
(They throw us slugs we throwing 'em back, what)
Bring the shit man, live, man
(Fuck that son, word up) 9-6 shit
