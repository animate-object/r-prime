[Hook: Jully Black, and (un-credited male vocals)]
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Or save it all for you?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I, fill the tank up, put gas, and be out the front door in a (flash)
Before reconsidering, this Hell with you
It ain't you, it's the thing you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would've fell with you
To Hell with you

[Verse 1: Nas]
If Heaven was a mile away, and you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens, would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder, finally believe in his power
Even if you couldn't see him, but you could feel him, would you still doubt him?
How would you start acting? would you try to put the keys down?
Thinking every drug sale that you make in the streets, he can see now
Would a fiend even want to get high? would he stop smoking?
If he knew on his own two feet, he could just stroll in
To get away and escape from the craziness, and I bet you there's a Heaven for a atheist
It's hard taking this, racist planet, where they take a younger brother in a hand-cuff
Even if he innocent, "Nigga get on the car! put your motherfucking hands up!"
Thinking I'mma lose it
My mom's in chemo, three times a week yo, keep trying but people
It's hard, and God your young soldier's not so bold, but needs you
This world's my home but world I will leave you

[Verse 2: Nas]
Nigga what you think, I'mma stop building?
I'mma stop feeling like I'm Amistad's great- great-grandchildren?
How I'm not gonna want to make millions
Since the quarter water days, in the hallways making fake gold caps
With the Reeses Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while that same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time took 'em cats, never looked back, Cristal, blowing dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me, you see the broads and Bentleys is nothing
Lest my niggas spend it all with me, I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all about some new kicks free
Of any autographs, and not to be recognized forgive me
It's becoming unbearable, making hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on a hook, there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise, preachers touching on alter boys
Sodomizing, not realizing God is watching, before the Lord
How could they do the Devil's work?
A man give another man head in Church
Hell it hurts just to fathom the thought, wishing that I fled the earth

[Outro: Nas]
You trapped in your own Hell
Everyday I wake up, I'm blessed
Everyday you wake up and breathe another breath, you blessed
To all them niggas running around talking about:
"I'm fucked up", "I got to get on", "I got to...", "I'm in the grind", "I'm fucked up"
Yeah we all in the grind, but look at the beautiful shit around you, it's a beautiful life
All my niggas locked up, keep your heads up, Heaven's just a mile away
I'm talking Heaven on Earth, ain't got nothing to do with money, got nothing to do with nothing material
I'm talking about Heaven in your own heart, in your own world baby, in your own existence
To my mom's look at me baby, I love you girl, your boy's shining, God's son
