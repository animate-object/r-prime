[Verse]
Listen up, gangstas and honeys with your hair done
Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son
Dog, whatever they call you; God, just listen
I spit a story backwards, it starts at the ending
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet hole's closing this chest of a nigga
Now he back to square one
Screaming, "shoot don't please"
I put my fifth back on my hip
It's like a VCR rewinding a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch
My caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Going reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out something crazy like, "go he there"
Sitting in back of this chair, we hittin' the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt
The blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinning records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van, back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, "outside right we"
So with my mouth wide, holding my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
â€˜Cause Jungle said, "Block your on enemy's the"
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed, thinking 'bout this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, "no hell," she talking 'bout, "me kiss"
Bobbed her head then spit the nut back in my dick
Started sucking with no hands, a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, "stressed really I'm"
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walking through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said, "Son, we found that nigga we gotta kill."

[Outro]
Ayo son, ayo son, you hear me, you hear me?
Listen, man, this dude right on the block
Right now, man, I found him, right now
I see him right now; let's kill him!
"Yo, this Nas, leave it; peace."
