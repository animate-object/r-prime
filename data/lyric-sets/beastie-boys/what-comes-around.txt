~TITLE What Comes Around
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Overripe, fresh-skeezed, California females
With 3-inch, cherry red, press-on Lee nails
Reach into my mind for the rhymes I'm seeking
Like a garbage bag full, overflowing (please) now it's leaking
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair
So I can climb up and get into your underwear
Rat soup eating, test cheating, no business punk
You're insecure, born in the junkyard with the junk
You've gone wet look crazy and messed with your head
You fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head
You're all mixed up, like pasta primavera
Yo, why'd you throw that chair at Geraldo Rivera, man?
Cause one man's ceiling is another man's floor
So get that money out of your ass, you whore
Well, I brought her upstairs onto the roof
I dogged your wife, and she is a doofus

So what goes around comes around
And what goes around comes around
What goes around comes around
And what comes around goes around (goes around)
Chosen bound
Fully down
Feeling down
Yo, Holmes, your nose is brown

Clean B, cleaning the G spot, you know that we've got
The Dolemite's house and you have not
Look out my window, look over the city
With two black eyes, your girl ain't that pretty
Why you wanna beat that brat with a bat
Why you wanna treat your girl like that?
Living in the rat race, smoking rat weed
Well, you reap what you sow when you plant the seed
Bum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto
Got more Louie than Phillip Rizzuto

What goes around comes around
And what goes around comes around
What goes around comes around
And what comes around goes around
What goes around comes around
And what goes around inevitability
Comes around, what?
And what goes around comes around
What goes around, you know, it comes around
What?
Check it, check it
Check it, what, what, what, what
Funky damn, a funky Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam
Bam, bam, bam
FD in the house, y'all
Funky, funky, funky, funky, f-funky
Bam, bam, bam, bam
FD
Funky, funky, FD, funky, funky
Fuck it
Ah, everybody, funky Pam
Bam, bam, bam, slam, Alabama
And kick it, Al-a-fucking-bama
I slam a saki hammer
And chilling
Funky
Like penicillin
Funky
Like panasaursas
Funky
Doris the Finkasaurus
Ha, he, ha, ha, ha
